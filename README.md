The goal of this project was to predict the price of diamonds using machine-learning models. The models I have tried were the Lineal Regression, Support Vector Regressor(SVR), Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor.

The folder is structured in the following way:

- Input: The original database of diamonds where I had to try the different models and the test database to try the models.
- Output: The different predictions that I have extracted from the models I have used.
- Diamonds.ipynb: The jupyter notebook where I have cleaned the database and try the different models. The difference with the other jupyter notebook is that in this one I was trying with dummies in the categorical columns.
- prueba-sin-dummies.ipynb: In this jupyter notebook I was trying to train the model scaling the values in the categorical columns instead of doing dummies.
